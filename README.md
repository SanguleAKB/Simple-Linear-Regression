<h1>Simple Linear Regression</h1>

<h3>What is Linear Regression ?</h3>
<p> “Regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the data points on a target-predictor graph in such a way that the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line is minimum.”</p>

<h2>Following are same steps that I follow for buliding model</h2>
<br>
<p>1. Download dataset from the Kaggle.</p>
<br>
<p>2.Visualize the data present in database using the seaborn. With the help of visualization we can decide which feature scaling method is helpful.Here I used the Standardization.</p>
<br>
<p>3.I devide the data in 2 part a.y= dependent feature and b.x=independent feature </p>
<br>
<p>4.With the help sklearn library I devide my data in four part 1.X_train 2.y_train 3.X_test 4.y_test</p>
<br>
<p>5.After the from Standardization.</p>
<br>
<p>At the end we can able to drown fit fit line of linear regression</p>
